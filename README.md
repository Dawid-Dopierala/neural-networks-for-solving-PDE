# neural-networks-for-solving-PDE
Using neural networks for solving PDE, implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07469.pdf done for "Machine Learning B" class. The code is not yet finished, there seems to be a problem with the Burger equation (or not enought iterations) but American put works well.
